## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

it to create a new [default][repo_default_config] config file:

```console
go run github.com/koddr/{{PROJECT}}@latest init
```

Edit a config file with your settings and options. 

Next, run a generation process to build Docker files to deploy your project:

```console
go run github.com/koddr/{{PROJECT}}@latest generate
```

And now, deploy your project by the generated `Dockerfile` and 
`docker-compose.yml` files in the current folder to the remote server.
